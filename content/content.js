# Welcome to The Pledge.

---

This is a game about the transition to net zero.
 
You'll be playing in teams. Each team is a different bank.

---

## Your objectives:

- To be a profitable, successful bank
- To take care of the planet

You'll have to balance these long term and short term priorities.

---

## Tokens

---

Each bank has 6 tokens. This represents your rate of Return on Equity and your bank's market position. 

---

If your tokens drop to zero, that means you're no longer competitive. 

---

## SECOND CURRENCY

---

Each player has a bonus.

This is not for your bank, this is just for you. 

It represents your salary bonus and your chance of promotion.

---

## ROUNDS

---

Everyone get a piece of paper and draw a thick arrow on it. 

[Image of arrow]
 
There are 3 rounds. In each round, each bank will make a public commitment towards your net zero plans.  
 
You'll decide whether your bank is going to RAISE your commitment (arrow up) or STICK to your current commitment

---

To announce your commitment, one person from each bank will hold their arrow up to the camera pointing up or down. We'll do that simultaneously.

We'll do a practice round now. 

---

Hold your arrow up to the camera in

---

Hold your arrow up to the camera in
## 2

---

Hold your arrow up to the camera in
## 1

---

## Reveal

---

Now if all the banks do the same thing - if all the banks raise or all stick, then there's no change to your relative positions. 

But if some banks raise and others stick, there are consequences.

---

The majority of shareholders today don't want their banks to make commitments that will cost them business. So shareholders will punish banks that risk their profitability.

---

If the banks do different things, then: 

All the banks who raised their commitment lose 2 tokens. 

All the banks who stuck with their current commitment gain 1 token.
 
So there's a strong first mover disadvantage.

---

# ROUND 1: NET ZERO ANNOUNCEMENT

---

There's a pressure on your banks to make a net zero announcement.

How ambitious will your commitment be?

---

You can RAISE your commitment to make a net zero commitment which includes all your sectors, and then figure out how to deliver that promise as you go forward.

Or you can STICK to your current commitments which focus only on high carbon sectors to begin with.

---

---

Each bank will now go to a different breakout room to make their decisions. 

---

Follow this link to a breakdown of your tasks for this first round.

In your groups, you'll decide:

---

### Who will be the first person to make the public announcement - who will hold up the piece of paper?

---

### What animal your bank is named after, and why. You can name it after an insect, a fish, a mammal, a bird, vertebrate, invertebrate. 

---

### Decide whether to raise your commitment or stick.

---

One more thing before you make your decision: there's a cost to changing course early on.

If you choose to raise your commitment this turn, you will pay 1 token in addition to anything that happens with the other banks.

---

You have five minutes. 

Good luck. 

---
<!-- theme=wait -->

Wait 5 mins.

---

Welcome back. 

Each bank introduce yourself: which animal are you, and why?
<!-- Louis todo -->
<!-- initialise banks -->

---

The player who is announcing the decision for each bank raise your hand.

---

Now get ready to reveal your arrow pointing up or down.

---

Those banks that have lost tokens:
So ____ Bank and ____ Bank are in some financial trouble. Shareholders are concerned, there are questions about stock prices. 

These banks may become financially unviable if they continue on this path.

---

<!-- Louis todo -->
At the end of the game, we'll use the total number of raised commitments to measure of how well the financial sector has transitioned to net zero.

So far, out of a total possible __ raised commitments, we have __.

---

So here are some of the public responses to the situation so far.

# PUBLIC PRESSURE CAMPAIGNS

---

Banks face external pressure to change their behaviour from civil society organisations and NGOs. 

---

That external pressure can be useful for people within the bank who are trying to encourage change.

---

In this game, you are going to make a choice as an individual, not with your bank.

You can choose to share some information about your bank with a climate NGO. 

To do this, use the private message function in the chat. Click on the name of the host and send them the word 'ALLY'.

Make sure you do it privately.

---

The first person to message the word 'ally' will invite that NGO to run a public campaign against their bank. 

That means that next turn, your bank will not earn any bonus tokens by sticking to its regular commitment.

---

The other members in your bank won't know who's had that conversation. It's entirely secret to you.

Messaging 'ally' will cost you your bonus.

---

[Players message ALLY to the facilitator]

When the facilitator has received a message, click on the bank that which that person belongs to.
<!-- Louis todo -->


---

<!-- Louis todo -->
Okay, so someone from ____ Bank has shared some information to the NGO. 

The NGO has used that information to run a campaign against ____ Bank. 

For those people who messaged the word ‘ally’ - your bonus is now gone. It’s up to you to keep track of that.

Next turn, ____ Bank can choose to raise its commitment or stick to its current commitment, same as usual. But if it chooses to stick to its current commitment and other banks raise, it won't earn any bonus tokens. 

---

---

# ROUND 2

---

It's now two years later. The big debate for banks now is about getting out of fossil fuels.

Climate NGOs argue that 2050 is too far away. They want banks to commit to more ambitious timeframes for phasing out fossil fuels.

On the other hand, an unrealistic deadline will make your bank look naive, and will be embarrassing if you can't achieve it.

Your bank's sustainability team has proposed to bring forward your deadline for phasing out fossil fuels to 2035.

---

You can RAISE your commitment and promise to be completely out of fossil fuels by 2035.

Or you can STICK with your current commitment and retain your deadline of no more fossil fuels by 2050.

Public pressure is mounting for significant climate action, but it's still costly for banks to make the first move if their peers don't follow.
Each bank will now go to a different breakout room to make their decisions. 

---

Follow this link to a breakdown of your tasks for this second round.

In your groups, you'll decide:

---

### Who will be the next person to make the public announcement - who will hold up the piece of paper? 

---

### In the next round of the game, each bank will need a lobbyist. Who will that be?

---

### Decide whether to raise your commitment or stick.

---

One more thing: if you stuck with your existing commitments in the last round, there's now a 2 token cost to raise your commitment. 
 
That's a 2 token cost on top of any costs from what other banks choose to do. 

---

You have five minutes. 

Good luck. 

---

<!-- theme=wait -->
Wait 5 mins.

---

## Welcome back. 

---

The player who is announcing the decision for each bank raise your hand.

---

Now get ready to reveal your arrow pointing up or down.

Reveal in 3, 2, 1, go.

*Players reveal.*

Each bank, what was your decision, and why?
 
*The voting person from each bank explains their decision.*

Those banks that have lost tokens:
So ____ Bank and ____ Bank are in some financial trouble. Shareholders are concerned, there are questions about stock prices.

At the end of the game, we'll use the total number of raised commitments to measure of how well the financial sector has transitioned to net zero.

So far, out of a total possible __ raised commitments, we have __.

# NEW REGULATION

---

In this round, we'll look at possible financial regulation.

To break the deadlock of climate inaction, financial regulators have put forward two possible policies. The banks will vote on which they prefer.

---

The first policy is GREEN SUBSIDIES. 

This is a package of laws which ease capital holding restrictions for sustainable loans and inject money directly into green sectors.

If we go with this policy, banks get 3 tokens for each occasion they’ve previously raised their commitment. 

---

The second policy is ENHANCED CREDIT GUIDANCE.

In this case, central banks and regulators to take a much more interventionist role and block certain kinds of loans to high-carbon sectors.

If we go with this policy, each bank pays 1 token, and we lose the transition cost for banks to raise their commitments. 

---

The lobbyists will now make a decision about which policy to vote for. 

Then you’ll have the opportunity to spend tokens to buy votes. 

You can negotiate with other banks and make the decision collectively if you like.

---

When you're ready:
<!-- Louis todo -->

____ bank, what would you like to vote for?
____ bank, what would you like to vote for?

Ask all banks their choice.

[Each bank announces their vote - the facilitator enters it in the field]

---

Would any lobbyist like to buy any additional votes? 

Feel free to talk to the other banks now in the chat or on video if you like. You can make an offer and collaborate to sway the vote.

---

<div style="font-size: .7em; width: 50%; display: inline-block">[The ideal here is a list of banks, with two buttons next to each bank: ‘Buy 1 vote for Green Subsidies’ and ‘Buy 1 vote for Enhanced Credit Guidance’. When a bank commits to buying a vote, the facilitator just clicks on that button and it adds a vote to the tally for that policy at the bottom of the screen. (See my attached image for an idea of how this might look.)]
</div>

<div style="width: 40%; display: inline-block">

</div>

<!-- Louis todo -->

---

<!-- Louis todo -->
The winning policy was: Green Subsidies / Enhanced Credit Guidance.

IF GREEN SUBSIDIES:
Each bank receives 3 tokens for each time they've raised their commitment. There will continue to be a transition cost to raise your commitment.
 
IF ENHANCED CREDIT GUIDANCE:
Each bank will pay 1 token.

Next turn, there would have been a 3 token cost for banks to transition to a raised commitment - that cost has now been removed.

---

These are the scores going into the final round.

Update re banks' scores.
<!-- Louis todo -->

---

# ROUND 3

---

It's now four years later. As severe weather events impact the planet, the urgency around climate action has reached a critical point. 

The question now is: how responsible are banks for the emissions of their clients? 

In this last round:

---

You can RAISE your commitment and financially incentivise your clients to accelerate their decarbonisation.

---

Or you can STICK to your current commitment and continue to honour your existing relationships.

---

This is the last round of the game. 

We'll be judging the success and profitability of your bank by your tokens after this round.

---

Each bank will now go to a different breakout room to make their decisions. 

Follow this link to a breakdown of your tasks for this second round.

In your groups, you'll decide:

---

## Who will be the next person to make the public announcement - who will hold up the piece of paper? 

## Decide whether to raise your commitment or stick.

---
<!-- Louis todo -->
IF THEY WENT WITH GREEN SUBSIDIES:
One more thing: if you stuck with your existing commitments in the last round, there's now a 3 token cost to raise your commitment. 
 
That's a 3 token cost on top of any costs from what other banks choose to do. 

IF THEY WENT WITH ENHANCED CREDIT GUIDANCE:
Because you went with enhanced credit guidance, there is no cost to raise your commitment if you stuck last turn. 

However, you still lose 2 tokens if you raise your commitment and other banks do not.

---

You have five minutes. 

Good luck. 

---
<!-- theme=wait -->
Wait 5 mins.

---

Welcome back. 

---

The player who is announcing the decision for each bank raise your hand.

Now get ready to reveal your arrow pointing up or down.

# NET ZERO
Finally, how did we go with our transition to net zero? 

In this game, we use the decisions you made as an indication of how the financial sector as a whole manages the transition to net zero. 

The more raised commitments you made collectively, the better for the planet.

---
<!-- Louis todo -->
We had [x] banks over three turns, so there were a total of [y] opportunities to raise your commitments. 

---
<!-- Louis todo -->
If we made [y] raised commitments, we could say that we are on a Paris-aligned pathway to 1.5 degrees above preindustrial levels.

---
<!-- Louis todo -->
Out of [y] possible raised commitments, you managed to make __.

---

<!-- Louis todo -->
APPROPRIATE OUTCOME

0-25% raised commitments
Thanks to rapid movement by the finance sector over the 2020s, the world on a  Paris-aligned pathway to 1.5 degrees above preindustrial levels. Of course, that still means a massive increase in severe weather events, the loss of many coastal ecosystems and the drying out of many agricultural regions.

There will still be some significant disruptions to the financial system expected over the coming decades, but overall it's possible to imagine a healthy planet going forward.

26-50% raised commitments
In the 2020s, the finance sector moved fairly quickly away from fossil-fuel based investments - but not quickly enough to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement.

The planet has passed the threshold of 1.5 degrees and is on track for more than 2 degrees warming. That means a massive increase in severe weather events, the loss of many coastal ecosystems and the drying out of many agricultural regions.

Some regions of the tropics may become uninhabitable due to rising heat, meaning the forced migration of millions of people by the end of the century. Massive recessions are very likely and there will be significant disruptions to the financial system. Still, things are better than they could be, and human ingenuity will hopefully help see us through.

51-75% raised commitments
In the 2020s, the finance sector struggled to transition away from carbon-intensive investments. Although some banks made serious commitments, many dragged their feet. As a result, the planet is on a pathway to approximately 3 degrees warming. 

This means the likely collapse of many ecosystems, the loss of many coastal cities. Large regions of the tropics will be uninhabitable due to rising heat, meaning the forced migration of hundreds of millions of people by the end of the century. Massive recessions are guaranteed and the collapse of the current economic system is a remote but real possibility.

76-100% raised commitments
In the 2020s, the finance sector failed to transition away from carbon-intensive investments. Although some banks made attempts to adjust, but most dragged their feet. As a result, the planet is on a pathway to a predicted 3.5 degrees warming. 

This means the likely collapse of many ecosystems, the loss of coastal cities. Large regions of the tropics will be uninhabitable due to rising heat, meaning the forced migration of hundreds of millions of people by the end of the century. Massive recessions are guaranteed and the collapse of the current economic system is a very real possibility.

---

We'll leave it to you to consider how your bank might fare in this changed ecosystem.
